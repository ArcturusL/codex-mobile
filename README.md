## 🤯 What Is This?
**`codexapp`** is a lightweight bridge that gives you a desktop browser UI for Codex app-server workflows.

This fork supports desktop web access. Telegram, mobile layouts, installable PWA, and Android/Termux runtimes are no longer supported. Build this fork from source to use these changes; the upstream npm package may differ.

You run one command. It starts a local web server. You open it from your machine, your LAN, or wherever your setup allows.  

**TL;DR 🧠: Codex app UI, unlocked for Linux, macOS, and Windows.**

---

## ⚡ Quick Start
> **The main event.**

```bash
# 🔓 Run instantly (recommended)
npx codexapp

# 🌐 Then open in browser
# http://localhost:18923
```

By default, `codexapp` now also starts:

```bash
cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:<port>
```

It prints the tunnel URL and password file location in startup output.
Use `--no-tunnel` to disable this behavior.

If you are using a provider or AI gateway that is already authenticated and do not want `codexapp` to force `codex login` during startup, use:

```bash
npx codexapp --no-login
```

### Linux 🐧
```bash
node -v   # should be 18+
npx codexapp
```

### Windows 🪟 (PowerShell)
```powershell
node -v   # 18+
npx codexapp
```

## ✨ Features
> **The payload.**

- 🚀 One-command launch with `npx codexapp`
- 🌍 Cross-platform support for Linux, macOS, and Windows
- 🖥️ Browser-first Codex UI flow on `http://localhost:18923`
- 🌐 LAN-friendly access from other devices on the same network
- 🧪 Remote/headless-friendly setup for server-based Codex usage
- 🔌 Works with reverse proxies and tunneling setups
- ⚡ No global install required for quick experimentation
- 🎙️ Built-in hold-to-dictate voice input with transcription to composer draft
- 💾 Project portability: export a project as a ZIP from project or thread menus, including matching Codex chat JSONL history under `.codex-project/chats/`
- 📦 Project import: restore exported project ZIPs from the browser via `Import Project`
- 🔁 Imported chats are rewritten for the destination `CODEX_HOME`, project path, and currently selected provider/model so they can be resumed in the new environment
- ⚙️ Project ZIP performance: exports stream ZIP bytes with response backpressure handling and skip generated/git-ignored folders; imports still buffer the selected ZIP once because the browser upload arrives as a single file

## 🧩 Recent Product Features (from main commits)
> **Not just launch. Actual UX upgrades.**

- 🗂️ Searchable project picker in new-thread flow
- ➕ "Create Project" button next to "Select folder" with browser prompt
- 📌 New projects get pinned to top automatically
- 🧠 Smart default new-project name suggestion via server-side free-directory scan (`New Project (N)`)
- 🔄 Project order persisted globally to workspace roots state
- 🧵 Optimistic in-progress threads preserved during refresh/poll cycles
- 🧪 Skills Hub event typing fix for `SkillCard` select emit compatibility
- 🎙️ Voice dictation flow in composer (`hold to dictate` -> transcribe -> append text)
